About this edition 
Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus was Emperor of Rome from 161 to his death, 
the last of the “Five Good Emperors.” He was nephew, son-in-law, and adoptive son 
of Antonius Pius. Marcus Aurelius was one of the most important Stoic philosophers, 
cited by H.P. Blavatsky amongst famous classic sages and writers such as Plato, Eu-
ripides, Socrates, Aristophanes, Pindar, Plutarch, Isocrates, Diodorus, Cicero, and 
Epictetus.1

Introduction 
ARCUS AURELIUS ANTONINUS was born on April 26, A.D. 121. His real 
name was M. Annius Verus, and he was sprung of a noble family which 
claimed descent from Numa, second King of Rome. Thus the most reli-
gious of emperors came of the blood of the most pious of early kings. His father, An-
nius Verus, had held high office in Rome, and his grandfather, of the same name, 
had been thrice Consul. Both his parents died young, but Marcus held them in lov-
ing remembrance. On his father’s death Marcus was adopted by his grandfather, the

ing remembrance. On his father’s death Marcus was adopted by his grandfather, the 
consular Annius Verus, and there was deep love between these two. On the very first 
page of his book Marcus gratefully declares how of his grandfather he had learned to 
be gentle and meek, and to refrain from all anger and passion. The Emperor Hadrian 
divined the fine character of the lad, whom he used to call not Verus but Verissimus, 
more Truthful than his own name. He advanced Marcus to equestrian rank when six 
years of age, and at the age of eight made him a member of the ancient Salian 
priesthood. The boy’s aunt, Annia Galeria Faustina, was married to Antoninus Pius, 
afterwards emperor. Hence it came about that Antoninus, having no son, adopted

afterwards emperor. Hence it came about that Antoninus, having no son, adopted 
Marcus, changing his name to that which he is known by, and betrothed him to his 
daughter Faustina. His education was conducted with all care. The ablest teachers 
were engaged for him, and he was trained in the strict doctrine of the Stoic philoso-
phy, which was his great delight. He was taught to dress plainly and to live simply, to 
avoid all softness and luxury. His body was trained to hardihood by wrestling, hunt-
ing, and outdoor games; and though his constitution was weak, he showed great 
personal courage to encounter the fiercest boars. At the same time he was kept from 
the extravagancies of his day. The great excitement in Rome was the strife of the Fac-

the extravagancies of his day. The great excitement in Rome was the strife of the Fac-
tions, as they were called, in the circus. The racing drivers used to adopt one of four 
colours — red, blue, white, or green — and their partisans showed an eagerness in 
supporting them which nothing could surpass. Riot and corruption went in the train 
of the racing chariots; and from all these things Marcus held severely aloof. 
In 140 Marcus was raised to the consulship, and in 145 his betrothal was consum-
mated by marriage. Two years later Faustina brought him a daughter; and soon after 
the tribunate and other imperial honours were conferred upon him.

younger son at the same time with Marcus, giving him the name of Lucius Aurelius 
Verus. Henceforth the two are colleagues in the empire, the junior being trained as it 
were to succeed. No sooner was Marcus settled upon the throne than wars broke out 
on all sides. In the east, Vologeses III. of Parthia began a long-meditated revolt by de-
stroying a whole Roman Legion and invading Syria (162). Verus was sent off in hot

caused by floods which had destroyed vast quantities of grain. After all had been 
done possible to allay famine and to supply pressing needs — Marcus being forced 
even to sell the imperial jewels to find money — both emperors set forth to a struggle 
which was to continue more or less during the rest of Marcus’s reign. During these 
wars, in 169, Verus died. We have no means of following the campaigns in detail; but

thus much is certain, that in the end the Romans succeeded in crushing the barbar-
ian tribes, and effecting a settlement which made the empire more secure. Marcus 
was himself commander-in-chief, and victory was due no less to his own ability than 
to his wisdom in choice of lieutenants, shown conspicuously in the case of Pertinax. 
There were several important battles fought in these campaigns; and one of them has 
become celebrated for the legend of the Thundering Legion. In a battle against the 
Quadi in 174, the day seemed to he going in favour of the foe, when on a sudden 
arose a great storm of thunder and rain the lightning struck the barbarians with ter-
ror, and they turned to rout. In later days this storm was said to have been sent in

ror, and they turned to rout. In later days this storm was said to have been sent in 
answer to the prayers of a legion which contained many Christians, and the name 
Thundering Legion should he given to it on this account. The title of Thundering Le-
gion is known at an earlier date, so this part of the story at least cannot be true; but 
the aid of the storm is acknowledged by one of the scenes carved on Antonine’s Col-
umn at Rome, which commemorates these wars. 
The settlement made after these troubles might have been more satisfactory but for 
an unexpected rising in the east. Avidius Cassius, an able captain who had won re-
nown in the Parthian wars, was at this time chief governor of the eastern provinces.

By whatever means induced, he had conceived the project of proclaiming himself 
emperor as soon as Marcus, who was then in feeble health, should die; and a report 
having been conveyed to him that Marcus was dead, Cassius did as he had planned. 
Marcus, on hearing the news, immediately patched up a peace and returned home to 
meet this new peril. The emperors great grief was that he must needs engage in the 
horrors of civil strife. He praised the qualities of Cassius, and expressed a heartfelt 
wish that Cassius might not be driven to do himself a hurt before he should have the 
opportunity to grant a free pardon. But before he could come to the east news had

come to Cassius that the emperor still lived; his followers fell away from him, and he 
was assassinated. Marcus now went to the east, and while there the murderers 
brought the head of Cassius to him; but the emperor indignantly refused their gift, 
nor would he admit the men to his presence. 
On this journey his wife, Faustina, died. At his return the emperor celebrated a tri-
umph (176). Immediately afterwards he repaired to Germany, and took up once more 
the burden of war. His operations were followed by complete success; but the trou-
bles of late years had been too much for his constitution, at no time robust, and on 
March 17, 180, he died in Pannonia.

Commodus, who succeeded him, undid the work of many campaigns by a hasty and 
unwise peace; and his reign of twelve years proved him to be a ferocious and blood-
thirsty tyrant. Scandal has made free with the name of Faustina herself, who is ac-
cused not only of unfaithfulness, but of intriguing with Cassius and egging him on to 
his fatal rebellion, it must be admitted that these charges rest on no sure evidence; 
and the emperor, at all events, loved her dearly, nor ever felt the slightest qualm of 
suspicion.

suspicion. 
As a soldier we have seen that Marcus was both capable and successful; as an ad-
ministrator he was prudent and conscientious. Although steeped in the teachings of 
philosophy, he did not attempt to remodel the world on any preconceived plan. He 
trod the path beaten by his predecessors, seeking only to do his duty as well as he 
could, and to keep out corruption. He did some unwise things, it is true. To create a 
compeer in empire, as he did with Verus, was a dangerous innovation which could 
only succeed if one of the two effaced himself; and under Diocletian this very prece-
dent caused the Roman Empire to split into halves. He erred in his civil administra-
tion by too much centralising. But the strong point of his reign was the administra-

tion by too much centralising. But the strong point of his reign was the administra-
tion of justice. Marcus sought by-laws to protect the weak, to make the lot of the 
slaves less hard, to stand in place of father to the fatherless. Charitable foundations 
were endowed for rearing and educating poor children. The provinces were protected 
against oppression, and public help was given to cities or districts which might be 
visited by calamity. The great blot on his name, and one hard indeed to explain, is 
his treatment of the Christians. In his reign Justin at Rome became a martyr to his 
faith, and Polycarp at Smyrna, and we know of many outbreaks of fanaticism in the 
provinces which caused the death of the faithful. It is no excuse to plead that he

from his own tone in speaking of the Christians it is clear he knew them only from 
calumny; and we hear of no measures taken even to secure that they should have a 
fair hearing. In this respect Trajan was better than he. 
To a thoughtful mind such a religion as that of Rome would give small satisfaction. 
Its legends were often childish or impossible; its teaching had little to do with morali-

this case all devout souls were thrown back upon philosophy, as they had been, 
though to a less extent, in Greece. There were under the early empire two rival 
schools which practically divided the field between them, Stoicism and Epicurean-
ism. The ideal set before each was nominally much the same. The Stoics aspired to 
the repression of all emotion, and the Epicureans to freedom from all disturbance; 
yet in the upshot the one has become a synonym of stubborn endurance, the other

worth while to sketch the history and tenets of the Stoic sect. Zeno, the founder of 
Stoicism, was born in Cyprus at some date unknown, but his life may be said rough-
ly to be between the years 350 and 250 B.C. Cyprus has been from time immemorial 
a meeting-place of the East and West, and although we cannot grant any importance 
to a possible strain of Phoenician blood in him (for the Phoenicians were no philoso-
phers), yet it is quite likely that through Asia Minor he may have come in touch with

the Far East. He studied under the cynic Crates, but he did not neglect other philo-
sophical systems. After many years’ study he opened his own school in a colonnade 
in Athens called the Painted Porch, or Stoa, which gave the Stoics their name. Next 
to Zeno, the School of the Porch owes most to Chrysippus (280–207 B.C.), who organ-
ised Stoicism into a system. Of him it was said, 
“But for Chrysippus, there had been no Porch.” 
The Stoics regarded speculation as a means to an end and that end was, as Zeno put 
it, to live consistently (ομολογουμένως ζήν) or as it was later explained, to live in con-

it, to live consistently (ομολογουμένως ζήν) or as it was later explained, to live in con-
formity with nature (ομολογουμένως τη φύσει ζήν). This conforming of the life to na-
ture was the Stoic idea of Virtue. This dictum might easily be taken to mean that vir-
tue consists in yielding to each natural impulse; but that was very far from the Stoic 
meaning. In order to live in accord with nature, it is necessary to know what nature 
is; and to this end a threefold division of philosophy is made — into Physics, dealing 
with the universe and its laws, the problems of divine government and teleology; Log-
ic, which trains the mind to discern true from false; and Ethics, which applies the 
knowledge thus gained and tested to practical life.

The Stoic system of physics was materialism with an infusion of pantheism. In con-
tradiction to Plato’s view that the Ideas, or Prototypes, of phenomena alone really ex-
ist, the Stoics held that material objects alone existed; but immanent in the material 
universe was a spiritual force which acted through them, manifesting itself under 
many forms, as fire, aether, spirit, soul, reason, the ruling principle. 
The universe, then, is God, of whom the popular gods are manifestations; while leg-
ends and myths are allegorical. The soul of man is thus an emanation from the god-

ends and myths are allegorical. The soul of man is thus an emanation from the god-
head, into whom it will eventually be re-absorbed. The divine ruling principle makes 
all things work together for good, but for the good of the whole. The highest good of 
man is consciously to work with God for the common good, and this is the sense in 
which the Stoic tried to live in accord with nature. In the individual it is virtue alone 
which enables him to do this; as Providence rules the universe, so virtue in the soul 
must rule man. 
In Logic, the Stoic system is noteworthy for their theory as to the test of truth, the 
Criterion. They compared the new-born soul to a sheet of paper ready for writing. Up-
on this the senses write their impressions (φαντασίαι), and by experience of a num-

called καταληπτική φαντασία, one that holds fast, or as they explained it, one proceed-

were tested by this “holding perception.” 
Of the Ethical application I have already spoken. The highest good was the virtuous 
life. Virtue alone is happiness, and vice is unhappiness. Carrying this theory to its

tue may act. The ideal Wise Man is sufficient unto himself in all things (αυταρκής); 
and knowing these truths, he will be happy even when stretched upon the rack. It is 
probable that no Stoic claimed for himself that he was this Wise Man, but that each 
strove after it as an ideal much as the Christian strives after a likeness to Christ. The 
exaggeration in this statement was, however, so obvious, that the later Stoics were 
driven to make a further subdivision of things indifferent into what is preferable 
(προηγμένα) and what is undesirable (αποπροηγμένα). They also held that for him

who had not attained to the perfect wisdom, certain actions were proper (καθήκοντα). 
These were neither virtuous nor vicious, but, like the indifferent things, held a mid-
dle place. 
Two points in the Stoic system deserve special mention. One is a careful distinction 
between things which are in our power and things which are not. Desire and dislike, 
opinion and affection, are within the power of the will; whereas health, wealth, hon-
our, and other such are generally not so. The Stoic was called upon to control his 
desires and affections, and to guide his opinion; to bring his whole being under the 
sway of the will or leading principle, just as the universe is guided and governed by

sway of the will or leading principle, just as the universe is guided and governed by 
divine Providence. This is a special application of the favourite Greek virtue of mod-
eration (σωφροσύνη), and has also its parallel in Christian ethics. The second point is 
a strong insistence on the unity of the universe, and on man’s duty as part of a great 
whole. Public spirit was the most splendid political virtue of the ancient world, and it 
is here made cosmopolitan. It is again instructive to note that Christian sages insist-
ed on the same thing. Christians are taught that they are members of a worldwide 
brotherhood, where is neither Greek nor Hebrew, bond nor free and that they live 
their lives as fellow-workers with God.

Such is the system which underlies the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. Some 
knowledge of it is necessary to the right understanding of the book, but for us the 
chief interest lies elsewhere. We do not come to Marcus Aurelius for a treatise on 
Stoicism. He is no head of a school to lay down a body of doctrine for students; he 
does not even contemplate that others should read what he writes. His philosophy is 
not an eager intellectual inquiry, but more what we should call religious feeling. The 
uncompromising stiffness of Zeno or Chrysippus is softened and transformed by 
passing through a nature reverent and tolerant, gentle and free from guile; the grim

passing through a nature reverent and tolerant, gentle and free from guile; the grim 
resignation which made life possible to the Stoic sage becomes in him almost a mood 
of aspiration. His book records the innermost thoughts of his heart, set down to ease 
it, with such moral maxims and reflections as may help him to bear the burden of 
duty and the countless annoyances of a busy life. 
It is instructive to compare the Meditations with another famous book, the Imitation 
of Christ. There is the same ideal of self-control in both. It should be a man’s task, 
says the Imitation, “to overcome himself, and every day to be stronger than himself.”

est self-reliance, the Christian aims at a more passive mood, humbleness and meek-
ness, and reliance on the presence and personal friendship of God. The Roman scru-
tinises his faults with severity, but without the self-contempt which makes the Chris-
tian “vile in his own sight.” The Christian, like the Roman, bids “study to withdraw 
thine heart from the love of things visible”; but it is not the busy life of duty he has in 
mind so much as the contempt of all worldly things, and the “cutting away of all low-
er delectations.” Both rate men’s praise or blame at their real worthlessness; “Let not

er delectations.” Both rate men’s praise or blame at their real worthlessness; “Let not 
thy peace,” says the Christian, “be in the mouths of men.” But it is to God’s censure 
the Christian appeals, the Roman to his own soul. The petty annoyances of injustice 
or unkindness are looked on by each with the same magnanimity. “Why doth a little 
thing said or done against thee make thee sorry? It is no new thing; it is not the first, 
nor shall it be the last, if thou live long. At best suffer patiently, if thou canst not suf-
fer joyously.” The Christian should sorrow more for other men’s malice than for our 
own wrongs; but the Roman is inclined to wash his hands of the offender. “Study to 
be patient in suffering and bearing other men’s defaults and all manner infirmities,”

says the Christian; but the Roman would never have thought to add, “If all men were 
perfect, what had we then to suffer of other men for God?” The virtue of suffering in 
itself is an idea which does not meet us in the Meditations. Both alike realise that 
man is one of a great community. “No man is sufficient to himself,” says the Chris-
tian; “we must bear together, help together, comfort together.” But while he sees a 
chief importance in zeal, in exalted emotion that is, and avoidance of lukewarmness, 
the Roman thought mainly of the duty to be done as well as might be, and less of the 
feeling which should go with the doing of it. To the saint as to the emperor, the world

is a poor thing at best. “Verily it is a misery to live upon the earth,” says the Chris-
tian; few and evil are the days of man’s life, which passeth away suddenly as a shad-
ow. 
But there is one great difference between the two books we are considering. The Imi-
tation is addressed to others, the Meditations by the writer to himself. We learn noth-
ing from the Imitation of the author’s own life, except in so far as he may be assumed 
to have practised his own preachings; the Meditations reflect mood by mood the mind 
of him who wrote them. In their intimacy and frankness lies their great charm. These

notes are not sermons; they are not even confessions. There is always an air of self-
consciousness in confessions; in such revelations there is always a danger of unctu-

fence, and John Bunyan himself exaggerates venial peccadilloes into heinous sins. 
But Marcus Aurelius is neither vulgar nor unctuous; he extenuates nothing, but 
nothing sets down in malice. He never poses before an audience; he may not be pro-
found, he is always sincere. And it is a lofty and serene soul which is here disclosed 
before us. Vulgar vices seem to have no temptation for him; this is not one tied and 
bound with chains which he strives to break. The faults he detects in himself are of-

ten such as most men would have no eyes to see. To serve the divine spirit which is

evil affection, from all rashness and vanity, and from all manner of discontent, either 
in regard of the gods or men”: or, as he says elsewhere, “unspotted by pleasure, un-
daunted by pain.” Unwavering courtesy and consideration are his aims. “Whatsoever

pity, not wrath; those who must needs be corrected, should be treated with tact and 
gentleness; and one must be always ready to learn better. “The best kind of revenge 
is, not to become like unto them.” There are so many hints of offence forgiven, that 
we may believe the notes followed sharp on the facts. Perhaps he has fallen short of 
his aim, and thus seeks to call his principles to mind, and to strengthen himself for 
the future. That these sayings are not mere talk is plain from the story of Avidius

the future. That these sayings are not mere talk is plain from the story of Avidius 
Cassius, who would have usurped his imperial throne. Thus the emperor faithfully 
carries out his own principle, that evil must be overcome with good. For each fault in 
others, Nature (says he) has given us a counteracting virtue; “as, for example, 
against the unthankful, it hath given goodness and meekness, as an antidote.” 
One so gentle towards a foe was sure to be a good friend; and indeed his pages are 
full of generous gratitude to those who had served him. In his First Book he sets 
down to account all the debts due to his kinsfolk and teachers. To his grandfather he 
owed his own gentle spirit, to his father shamefastness and courage; he learnt of his

owed his own gentle spirit, to his father shamefastness and courage; he learnt of his 
mother to be religious and bountiful and single-minded. Rusticus did not work in 
vain, if he showed his pupil that his life needed amending. Apollonius taught him 
simplicity, reasonableness, gratitude, a love of true liberty. So the list runs on; every 
one he had dealings with seems to have given him something good, a sure proof of 
the goodness of his nature, which thought no evil. 
If his was that honest and true heart which is the Christian ideal, this is the more 
wonderful in that he lacked the faith which makes Christians strong. He could say, it

small, that he does not hope for any personal happiness beyond what a serene soul 
may win in this mortal life. “O my soul, the time I trust will be, when thou shalt be

him, but their especial care is for the universe at large: thus much should suffice. 
His gods are better than the Stoic gods, who sit aloof from all human things, untrou-
bled and uncaring, but his personal hope is hardly stronger. On this point he says 
little, though there are many allusions to death as the natural end; doubtless he ex-
pected his soul one day to be absorbed into the universal soul, since nothing comes 
out of nothing, and nothing can be annihilated. His mood is one of strenuous weari-

he gropes blindly after something less empty and vain. “Thou hast taken ship,” he 
says, “thou hast sailed, thou art come to land, go out, if to another life, there also 
shalt thou find gods, who are everywhere.” There is more in this than the assumption 
of a rival theory for argument’s sake. If worldly things “be but as a dream, the

corn of wheat, which is not quickened except it die? Nature’s marvellous power of 
recreating out of Corruption is surely not confined to bodily things. Many of his 
thoughts sound like far-off echoes of St. Paul; and it is strange indeed that this most 
Christian of emperors has nothing good to say of the Christians. To him they are only 
sectaries “violently and passionately set upon opposition.”

------------------------------
cient religions were for the most part concerned with outward things. Do the neces-
sary rites, and you propitiate the gods; and these rites were often trivial, sometimes 
violated right feeling or even morality. Even when the gods stood on the side of right-
eousness, they were concerned with the act more than with the intent. But Marcus 
Aurelius knows that what the heart is full of, the man will do. “Such as thy thoughts 
and ordinary cogitations are,” he says, “such will thy mind be in time.” And every 
page of the book shows us that he knew thought was sure to issue in act. He drills 
his soul, as it were, in right principles, that when the time comes, it may be guided 
by them. To wait until the emergency is to be too late.

He sees also the true essence of happiness. “If happiness did consist in pleasure, 
how came notorious robbers, impure abominable livers, parricides, and tyrants, in so 
large a measure to have their part of pleasures?” He who had all the world’s pleas-
ures at command can write thus “A happy lot and portion is, good inclinations of the 
soul, good desires, good actions.” 
By the irony of fate this man, so gentle and good, so desirous of quiet joys and a 
mind free from care, was set at the head of the Roman Empire when great dangers 
threatened from east and west. For several years he himself commanded his armies

shows how he could retire within himself amid the coarse clangour of arms. The 
pomps and glories which he despised were all his; what to most men is an ambition 
or a dream, to him was a round of weary tasks which nothing but the stern sense of 
duty could carry him through. And he did his work well. His wars were slow and te-
dious, but successful. With a statesman’s wisdom he foresaw the danger to Rome of 
the barbarian hordes from the north, and took measures to meet it. As it was, his

plan of pushing the imperial frontiers to the Elbe, which seems to have been in his 
mind, much more might have been accomplished. But death cut short his designs. 
Truly a rare opportunity was given to Marcus Aurelius of showing what the mind can 
do in despite of circumstances. Most peaceful of warriors, a magnificent monarch 
whose ideal was quiet happiness in home life, bent to obscurity yet born to great-
ness, the loving father of children who died young or turned out hateful, his life was

schools and auditories, and to get me good and able teachers at home; and that I 
ought not to think much, if upon such occasions, I were at excessive charges.

tions of the coursers in the circus, called Prasini, and Veneti: nor in the amphithea-

those things, which are commonly spoken, by such as take upon them to work won-

who profess philosophy. 
IV. To Rusticus I am beholding, that I first entered into the conceit that my life want-
ed some redress and cure. And then, that I did not fall into the ambition of ordinary 
sophists, either to write tracts concerning the common theorems, or to exhort men 
unto virtue and the study of philosophy by public orations; as also that I never by

VII. From Alexander the Grammarian, to be unreprovable myself, and not reproach-
fully to reprehend any man for a barbarism, or a solecism, or any false pronuncia-
tion, but dextrously by way of answer, or testimony, or confirmation of the same 
matter (taking no notice of the word) to utter it as it should have been spoken; or by 
some other such close and indirect admonition, handsomely and civilly to tell him of 
it.

VIII. Of Fronto, to how much envy and fraud and hypocrisy the state of a tyrannous 
king is subject unto, and how they who are commonly called ευπατρίδαι, i.e. nobly 
born, are in some sort incapable, or void of natural affection. 
IX. Of Alexander the Platonic, not often nor without great necessity to say, or to write 
to any man in a letter, “I am not at leisure”; nor in this manner still to put off those 
duties, which we owe to our friends and acquaintances (to every one in his kind) un-
der pretence of urgent affairs. 
X. Of Catulus, not to contemn any friend’s expostulation, though unjust, but to 
strive to reduce him to his former disposition: freely and heartily to speak well of all 
my masters upon any occasion, as it is reported of Domitius, and Athenodotus: and

Dio, and Brutus. He it was also that did put me in the first conceit and desire of an

what he would, or would not, so open and plain was he. 
XII. From Claudius Maximus,5 in all things to endeavour to have power of myself, 
and in nothing to be carried about; to be cheerful and courageous in all sudden 
chances and accidents, as in sicknesses: to love mildness, and moderation, and 
gravity: and to do my business, whatsoever it be, thoroughly, and without queru-

XIII. In my father, I observed his meekness; his constancy without wavering in those 
things, which after a due examination and deliberation, he had determined. How free 
from all vanity he carried himself in matter of honour and dignity, (as they are es-
teemed): his laboriousness and assiduity, his readiness to hear any man, that had

neither absolutely requiring of his friends, that they should wait upon him at his or-
dinary meals, nor that they should of necessity accompany him in his journeys; and 
that whensoever any business upon some necessary occasions was to be put off and 
omitted before it could be ended, he was ever found when he went about it again, the 
same man that he was before. His accurate examination of things in consultations,

they seemed unto me most to desire; and that I did not put them off with hope and 
expectation, that (since that they were yet but young) I would do the same hereafter.

EMEMBER HOW LONG thou hast already put off these things, and how often a 
certain day and hour as it were, having been set unto thee by the gods, thou 
hast neglected it. It is high time for thee to understand the true nature both 
of the world, whereof thou art a part; and of that Lord and Governor of the world, 
from whom, as a channel from the spring, thou thyself didst flow: and that there is 
but a certain limit of time appointed unto thee, which if thou shalt not make use of 
to calm and allay the many distempers of thy soul, it will pass away and thou with it,

show how unsatisfactory it is. C. translates “εύ γάρ ό βίος εκάστω ως παρ’ εαυτώ,” which I do not understand.

VII. Theophrastus, where he compares sin with sin (as after a vulgar sense such 
things I grant may be compared): says well and like a philosopher, that those sins 
are greater which are committed through lust, than those which are committed 
through anger. For he that is angry seems with a kind of grief and close contraction 
of himself, to turn away from reason; but he that sins through lust, being overcome 
by pleasure, doth in his very sin bewray a more impotent, and unmanlike disposi-
tion. Well then and like a philosopher doth he say, that he of the two is the more to

tion. Well then and like a philosopher doth he say, that he of the two is the more to 
be condemned, that sins with pleasure, than he that sins with grief. For indeed this 
latter may seem first to have been wronged, and so in some manner through grief 
thereof to have been forced to be angry, whereas he who through lust doth commit 
anything, did of himself merely resolve upon that action. 
VIII. Whatsoever thou dost affect, whatsoever thou dost project, so do, and so project 
all, as one who, for aught thou knowest, may at this very present depart out of this 
life. And as for death, if there be any gods, it is no grievous thing to leave the society 
of men. The gods will do thee no hurt, thou mayest be sure. But if it be so that there

take care for the world; and as for those things which be truly evil, as vice and. wick-

he would: and had there been anything besides that had been truly bad and evil, 
they would have had a care of that also, that a man might have avoided it. But why 
should that be thought to hurt and prejudice a man’s life in this world, which cannot

these things, or if not as ignorant of them, yet as unable either to prevent, or better 
to order and dispose them. It cannot be that she through want either of power or 
skill, should have committed such a thing, so as to suffer all things both good and 
bad, equally and promiscuously, to happen unto all both good and bad. As for life 
therefore, and death, honour and dishonour, labour and pleasure, riches and pov-

things which of themselves are neither good nor bad; because of themselves, neither

XII. If thou shouldst live three thousand, or as many as ten thousands of years, yet 
remember this, that man can part with no life properly, save with that little part of 
life, which he now lives: and that which he lives, is no other, than that which at every 
instant he parts with. That then which is longest of duration, and that which is 
shortest, come both to one effect. For although in regard of that which is already past

there may be some inequality, yet that time which is now present and in being, is

manifestly appear, that it can be but a moment of time, that we then part with. For 
as for that which is either past or to come, a man cannot be said properly to part 
with it. For how should a man part with that which he hath not? These two things 
therefore thou must remember. First, that all things in the world from all eternity, by

only which is present, is that, which either of them can lose, as being that only 
which they have; for that which he hath not, no man can truly be said to lose.

XV. The time of a man’s life is as a point; the substance of it ever flowing, the sense 
obscure; and the whole composition of the body tending to corruption. His soul is

things belonging to the body; as a dream, or as a smoke, so are all that belong unto 
the soul. Our life is a warfare, and a mere pilgrimage. Fame after life is no better

MAN MUST NOT ONLY CONSIDER how daily his life wasteth and decreaseth, but 
this also, that if he live long, he cannot be certain, whether his understand-
ing shall continue so able and sufficient, for either discreet consideration, in 
matter of businesses; or for contemplation: it being the thing, whereon true 
knowledge of things both divine and human, doth depend. For if once he shall begin 
to dote, his respiration, nutrition, his imaginative, and appetitive, and other natural 
faculties, may still continue the same: he shall find no want of them. But how to

thyself unto the gods, and to have care of all men in general: if thou shalt find that 
all other things in comparison of this, are but vile, and of little moment; then give not 
way to any other thing, which being once though but affected and inclined unto, it 
will no more be in thy power without all distraction as thou oughtest to prefer and to

VIII. Never esteem of anything as profitable, which shall ever constrain thee either to 
break thy faith, or to lose thy modesty; to hate any man, to suspect, to curse, to dis-
semble, to lust after anything, that requireth the secret of walls or veils. But he that 
preferreth before all things his rational part and spirit, and the sacred mysteries of 
virtue which issueth from it, he shall never lament and exclaim, never sigh; he shall 
never want either solitude or company: and which is chiefest of all, he shall live 
without either desire or fear. And as for life, whether for a long or short time he shall

without either desire or fear. And as for life, whether for a long or short time he shall 
enjoy his soul thus compassed about with a body, he is altogether indifferent. For if 
even now he were to depart, he is as ready for it, as for any other action, which may 
be performed with modesty and decency. For all his life long, this is his only care, 
that his mind may always be occupied in such intentions and objects, as are proper 
to a rational sociable creature. 
IX. In the mind that is once truly disciplined and purged, thou canst not find any-
thing, either foul or impure, or as it were festered: nothing that is either servile, or 
affected: no partial tie; no malicious averseness; nothing obnoxious; nothing con-

speak. 
X. Use thine opinative faculty with all honour and respect, for in her indeed is all: 
that thy opinion do not beget in thy understanding anything contrary to either na-
ture, or the proper constitution of a rational creature. The end and object of a ration-
al constitution is, to do nothing rashly, to be kindly affected towards men, and in all 
things willingly to submit unto the gods. Casting therefore all other things aside,

long can it last? which of all the virtues is the proper virtue for this present use? as 
whether meekness, fortitude, truth, faith, sincerity, contentation, or any of the rest? 
Of everything therefore thou must use thyself to say, This immediately comes from 
God, this by that fatal connection, and concatenation of things, or (which almost 
comes to one) by some coincidental casualty. And as for this, it proceeds from my

things that of themselves are altogether indifferent, as in my best judgment I con-

all sudden cures; so have thou always thy dogmata in a readiness for the knowledge 
of things, both divine and human: and whatsoever thou dost, even in the smallest 
things that thou dost, thou must ever remember that mutual relation, and connec-
tion that is between these two things divine, and things human. For without relation 
unto God, thou shalt never speed in any worldly actions; nor on the other side in any 
divine, without some respect had to things human.

never either speaking anything contrary to truth, or doing anything contrary to jus-
tice, is the only true property of a good man. And such a one, though no man should 
believe that he liveth as he doth, either sincerely and conscionably, or cheerful and 
contentedly; yet is he neither with any man at all angry for it, nor diverted by it from

HAT INWARD MISTRESS part of man if it be in its own true natural temper, is 
towards all worldly chances and events ever so disposed and affected, that it 
will easily turn and apply itself to that which may be, and is within its own 
power to compass, when that cannot be which at first it intended. For it never doth 
absolutely addict and apply itself to any one object, but whatsoever it is that it doth 
now intend and prosecute, it doth prosecute it with exception and reservation; so 
that whatsoever it is that falls out contrary to its first intentions, even that after-

that whatsoever it is that falls out contrary to its first intentions, even that after-

that are in his way; by which things indeed a little fire would have been quenched, 
but a great fire doth soon turn to its own nature, and so consume whatsoever comes 
in his way: yea by those very things it is made greater and greater.

exact and perfect rules of art.

from all businesses. A man cannot any whither retire better than to his own soul; he 
especially who is beforehand provided of such things within, which whensoever he 
doth withdraw himself to look in, may presently afford unto him perfect ease and 
tranquillity. By tranquillity I understand a decent orderly disposition and carriage, 
free from all confusion and tumultuousness. Afford then thyself this retiring contin-
ually, and thereby refresh and renew thyself. Let these precepts be brief and funda-

and the vanity of praise, and the inconstancy and variableness of human judgments

true nature is to be kind and sociable, as a citizen, as a mortal creature. Among oth-

those two be among the most obvious and at hand. One, that the things or objects 
themselves reach not unto the soul, but stand without still and quiet, and that it is

and alterations in the world thou thyself hast already been an eyewitness of in thy

IV. If to understand and to be reasonable be common unto all men, then is that rea-
son, for which we are termed reasonable, common unto all. If reason is general, then 
is that reason also, which prescribeth what is to be done and what not, common un-
to all. If that, then law. If law, then are we fellow-citizens. If so, then are we partners

to conceive, but look into the matter itself, and see what it is in very truth.

but what reason proceeding from that regal and supreme part, shall for the good and 
benefit of men, suggest unto thee. And secondly, if any man that is present shall be

that they themselves by whom he is remembered, shall soon after every one of them

XX. They will say commonly, Meddle not with many things, if thou wilt live cheerful-
ly. Certainly there is nothing better, than for a man to confine himself to necessary 
actions; to such and so many only, as reason in a creature that knows itself born for 
society, will command and enjoin. This will not only procure that cheerfulness, which 
from the goodness, but that also, which from the paucity of actions doth usually pro-
ceed. For since it is so, that most of those things, which we either speak or do, are 
unnecessary; if a man shall cut them off, it must needs follow that he shall thereby

men, after they had with all their might and main intended and prosecuted some one 
worldly thing or other did soon after drop away, and were resolved into the elements. 
But especially thou must call to mind them, whom thou thyself in thy lifetime hast

in altering those things that are, and in making others like unto them. So that we 
may say, that whatsoever is, is but as it were the seed of that which shall be. For if 
thou think that that only is seed, which either the earth or the womb receiveth, thou 
art very simple.

world doth account wise, see what things they fly and are afraid of; and what things 
they hunt after. 
XXXII. In another man’s mind and understanding thy evil Cannot subsist, nor in any 
proper temper or distemper of the natural constitution of thy body, which is but as it 
were the coat or cottage of thy soul. Wherein then, but in that part of thee, wherein

morrow, or next day, thou wouldst not, except thou wert extremely base and pusil-
lanimous, take it for a great benefit, rather to die the next day after, than to-morrow;

XXXIX. Let it be thy perpetual meditation, how many physicians who once looked so 
grim, and so tetrically shrunk their brows upon their patients, are dead and gone 
themselves. How many astrologers, after that in great ostentation they had foretold 
the death of some others, how many philosophers after so many elaborate tracts and

XLI. Oh, wretched I, to whom this mischance is happened! nay, happy I, to whom 
this thing being happened, I can continue without grief; neither wounded by that 
which is present, nor in fear of that which is to come. For as for this, it might have 
happened unto any man, but any man having such a thing befallen him, could not 
have continued without grief. Why then should that rather be an unhappiness, than 
this a happiness? But however, canst thou, O man! term that unhappiness, which is 
no mischance to the nature of man I Canst thou think that a mischance to the na-

no mischance to the nature of man I Canst thou think that a mischance to the na-

thou learned is the will of man’s nature? Doth that then which hath happened unto 
thee, hinder thee from being just? or magnanimous? or temperate? or wise? or cir-
cumspect? or true? or modest? or free? or from anything else of all those things in 
the present enjoying and possession whereof the nature of man, (as then enjoying all 
that is proper unto her), is fully satisfied? Now to conclude; upon all occasion of sor-
row remember henceforth to make use of this dogma, that whatsoever it is that hath 
happened unto thee, is in very deed no such thing of itself, as a misfortune; but that

to bear it generously, is certainly great happiness. 
XLII. It is but an ordinary coarse one, yet it is a good effectual remedy against the 
fear of death, for a man to consider in his mind the examples of such, who greedily 
and covetously (as it were) did for a long time enjoy their lives. What have they got 
more, than they whose deaths have been untimely? Are not they themselves dead at 
the last? as Cadiciant’s, Fabius, Julianus Lepidus, or any other who in their lifetime 
having buried many, were at the last buried themselves. The whole space of any 
man’s life, is but little; and as little as it is, with what troubles, with what manner of

man’s life, is but little; and as little as it is, with what troubles, with what manner of

therefore unto thee altogether as a matter of indifferency. For if thou shalt look 
backward; behold, what an infinite chaos of time doth present itself unto thee; and 
as infinite a chaos, if thou shalt look forward. In that which is so infinite, what dif-

three ages?

N THE MORNING when thou findest thyself unwilling to rise, consider with thyself 
presently, it is to go about a man’s work that I am stirred up. Am I then yet un-
willing to go about that, for which I myself was born and brought forth into this 
world? Or was I made for this, to lay me down, and make much of myself in a warm 
bed? “O but this is pleasing.” And was it then for this that thou wert born, that thou 
mightest enjoy pleasure? Was it not in very truth for this, that thou mightest always 
be busy and in action? Seest thou not how all things in the world besides, how every

derly universe) naturally doth become and belong unto thin? And wilt not thou do 
that, which belongs unto a man to do? Wilt not thou run to do that, which thy na-
ture doth require? “But thou must have some rest.” Yes, thou must. Nature hath of 
that also, as well as of eating and drinking, allowed thee a certain stint. But thou 
guest beyond thy stint, and beyond that which would suffice, and in matter of action, 
there thou comest short of that which thou mayest. It must needs be therefore, that

pleasure in their trade and profession, can even pine themselves at their works, and 
neglect their bodies and their food for it; and doest thou less honour thy nature, than 
an ordinary mechanic his trade; or a good dancer his art? than a covetous man his 
silver, and vainglorious man applause? These to whatsoever they take an affection, 
can be content to want their meat and sleep, to further that every one which he af-

that they take from themselves. But their progress is right to the end and object, 
which is in their way, as it were, and lieth just before them: that is, which is feasible 
and possible, whether it be that which at the first they proposed to themselves, or 
no. For which reason also such actions are termed κατορθώσεις,16 to intimate the di-
rectness of the way, by which they are achieved. Nothing must be thought to belong 
to a man, which doth not belong unto him as he is a man. These, the event of pur-

withdraw himself from these wherein external pomp and greatness doth consist, or 
any other like these; or the better he doth bear with the loss of these, the better he is 
accounted. 
XV. Such as thy thoughts and ordinary cogitations are, such will thy mind be in 
time. For the soul doth as it were receive its tincture from the fancies, and imagina-
tions. Dye it therefore and thoroughly soak it with the assiduity of these cogitations. 
As for example. Wheresoever thou mayest live, there it is in thy power to live well and 
happy. But thou mayest live at the Court, there then also mayest thou live well and

his good and benefit consist. Society therefore is the proper good of a rational crea-
ture. For that we are made for society, it hath long since been demonstrated. Or can 
any man make any question of this, that whatsoever is naturally worse and inferior, 
is ordinarily subordinated to that which is better? and that those things that are 
best, are made one for another? And those things that have souls, are better than 
those that have none? and of those that have, those best that have rational souls?

XVI. To desire things impossible is the part of a mad man. But it is a thing impossi-
ble, that wicked man should not commit some such things. Neither doth anything 
happen to any man, which in the ordinary course of nature as natural unto him doth 
not happen. Again, the same things happen unto others also. And truly, if either he 
that is ignorant that such a thing hath happened unto him, or he that is ambitious 
to be commended for his magnanimity, can be patient, and is not grieved: is it not a 
grievous thing, that either ignorance, or a vain desire to please and to be commend-
ed, should be more powerful and effectual than true prudence? As for the things

can affect and move herself, and according as the dogmata and opinions are, which 
she doth vouchsafe herself; so are those things which, as accessories, have any co-

XVII. After one consideration, man is nearest unto us; as we are bound to do them 
good, and to bear with them. But as he may oppose any of our true proper actions, 
so man is unto me but as a thing indifferent: even as the sun, or the wind, or some

but let it both circumscribe itself, and confine those affections to their own proper 
parts and members. But if at any time they do reflect and rebound upon the mind 
and understanding (as in an united and compacted body it must needs); then must 
thou not go about to resist sense and feeling, it being natural. However let not thy 
understanding to this natural sense and feeling, which whether unto our flesh pleas-
ant or painful, is unto us nothing properly, add an opinion of either good or bad and 
all is well.

perchance; and perchance, not so much as a name. And what is that but an empty 
sound, and a rebounding echo? Those things which in this life are dearest unto us, 
and of most account, they are in themselves but vain, putrid, contemptible. The most 
weighty and serious, if rightly esteemed, but as puppies, biting one another: or un-

tice, and truth, they long since, as one of the poets19 hath it, have abandoned this 
spacious earth, and retired themselves unto heaven. What is it then that doth keep

thing: and secondly, that their happiness doth consist in a disposition to, and in the

HE MATTER ITSELF, of which the universe doth consist, is of itself very tracta-
ble and pliable. That rational essence that doth govern it, bath in itself no 
cause to do evil. It bath no evil in itself; neither can it do anything that is evil: 
neither can anything be hurt by it. And all things are done and determined according 
to its will and prescript. 
II. Be it all one unto thee, whether half frozen or well warm; whether only slumber-
ing, or after a full sleep; whether discommended or commended thou do thy duty: or 
whether dying or doing somewhat else; for that also “to die,” must among the rest be

whether dying or doing somewhat else; for that also “to die,” must among the rest be 
reckoned as one of the duties and actions of our lives. 
III. Look in, let not either the proper quality, or the true worth of anything pass thee, 
before thou hast fully apprehended it. 
IV. All substances come soon to their change, and either they shall be resolved by 
way of exhalation (if so be that all things shall be reunited into one substance), or as 
others maintain, they shall be scattered and dispersed. As for that Rational Essence 
by which all things are governed, as it best understandeth itself, both its own dispo-
sition, and what it doth, and what matter it hath to do with and accordingly doth all 
things; so we that do not, no wonder, if we wonder at many things, the reasons

out intermission to pass unto another, God being ever in thy mind.

Those that be admired by them that are more moderate and restrained, are compre-

of sight. For we must not think otherwise of our lives, than as a mere exhalation of 
blood, or of an ordinary respiration of air. For what in our common apprehension is, 
to breathe in the air and to breathe it out again, which we do daily: so much is it and 
no more, at once to breathe out all thy respirative faculty into that common air from 
whence but lately (as being but from yesterday, and to-day), thou didst first breathe

carried up and down by the strength of our sensual appetites; or that we can gather, 
and live together; or that we can feed: for that in effect is no better, than that we can 
void the excrements of our food. What is it then that should be dear unto us? to hear 
a clattering noise? if not that, then neither to be applauded by the tongues of men.

thee? This I think: that in all thy motions and actions thou be moved, and restrained 
according to thine own true natural constitution and Construction only. And to this 
even ordinary arts and professions do lead us. For it is that which every art doth aim 
at, that whatsoever it is, that is by art effected and prepared, may be fit for that work 
that it is prepared for. This is the end that he that dresseth the vine, and he that

XXVIII. Do all things as becometh the disciple of Antoninus Pius. Remember his 
resolute constancy in things that were done by him according to reason, his equabil-

XXX. I consist of body and soul. Unto my body all things are indifferent, for of itself it 
cannot affect one thing more than another with apprehension of any difference; as 
for my mind, all things which are not within the verge of her own operation, are indif-
ferent unto her, and for her own operations, those altogether depend of her; neither 
does she busy herself about any, but those that are present; for as for future and 
past operations, those also are now at this present indifferent unto her.

XXXI. As long as the foot doth that which belongeth unto it to do, and the hand that 
which belongs unto it, their labour, whatsoever it be, is not unnatural. So a man as 
long as he doth that which is proper unto a man, his labour cannot be against na-
ture; and if it be not against nature, then neither is it hurtful unto him. But if it were 
so that happiness did consist in pleasure: how came notorious robbers, impure 
abominable livers, parricides, and tyrants, in so large a measure to have their part of 
pleasures? 
XXXII. Dost thou not see, how even those that profess mechanic arts, though in 
some respect they be no better than mere idiots, yet they stick close to the course of 
their trade, neither can they find in their heart to decline from it: and is it not a

XXXIV He that seeth the things that are now, hath Seen all that either was ever, or 
ever shall be, for all things are of one kind; and all like one unto another. Meditate 
often upon the connection of all things in the world; and upon the mutual relation

by substantial union, or, reduction of all substances into one. 
XXXV. Fit and accommodate thyself to that estate and to those occurrences, which 
by the destinies have been annexed unto thee; and love those men whom thy fate it 
is to live with; but love them truly. An instrument, a tool, an utensil, whatsoever it 
be, if it be fit for the purpose it was made for, it is as it should be though he per-

own will either to compass or avoid, if thou shalt propose unto thyself any of those 
things as either good, or evil; it must needs be that according as thou shalt either fall 
into that which thou dost think evil, or miss of that which thou dost think good, so

wilt thou be ready both to complain of the Gods, and to hate those men, who either 
shall be so indeed, or shall by thee be suspected as the cause either of thy missing of 
the one, or falling into the other. And indeed we must needs commit many evils, if we 
incline to any of these things, more or less, with an opinion of any difference. But if 
we mind and fancy those things only, as good and bad, which wholly depend of our 
own wills, there is no more occasion why we should either murmur against the Gods, 
or be at enmity with any man. 
XXXVII. We all work to one effect, some willingly, and with a rational apprehension of 
what we do: others without any such knowledge. As I think Heraclitus in a place

they have not indeed either in general, or particular deliberated of any of those 
things, that happen unto us in this world; yet God be thanked, that of those things 
that concern myself, it is lawful for me to deliberate myself, and all my deliberation is 
but concerning that which may be to me most profitable. Now that unto every one is 
most profitable, which is according to his own constitution and nature. And my na-

ture is, to be rational in all my actions and as a good, and natural member of a city 
and commonwealth, towards my fellow members ever to be sociably and kindly dis-
posed and affected. My city and country as I am Antoninus, is Rome; as a man, the 
whole world. Those things therefore that are expedient and profitable to those cities, 
are the only things that are good and expedient for me. 
XL. Whatsoever in any kind doth happen to any one, is expedient to the whole. And 
thus much to content us might suffice, that it is expedient for the whole in general. 
But yet this also shalt thou generally perceive, if thou dost diligently take heed, that 
whatsoever doth happen to any one man or men. . . . 24 And now I am content that

the one; the modesty of another; the liberality of a third; of another some other thing. 
For nothing can so much rejoice thee, as the resemblances and parallels of several

virtues, visible and eminent in the dispositions of those who live with thee; especially 
when, all at once, as near as may be, they represent themselves unto thee. And 
therefore thou must have them always in a readiness. 
XLIV. Dost thou grieve that thou dost weigh but so many pounds, and not three 
hundred rather? Just as much reason hast thou to grieve that thou must live but so 
many years, and not longer. For as for bulk and substance thou dost content thyself 
with that proportion of it that is allotted unto thee, so shouldst thou for time.

justice lead thee to it, do it, though they be never so much against it. But if any shall 
by force withstand thee, and hinder thee in it, convert thy virtuous inclination from 
one object unto another, from justice to contented equanimity, and cheerful pa-
tience: so that what in the one is thy hindrance, thou mayst make use of it for the 
exercise of another virtue: and remember that it was with due exception, and reser-
vation, that thou didst at first incline and desire. For thou didst not set thy mind up-
on things impossible. Upon what then? that all thy desires might ever be moderated 
with this due kind of reservation. And this thou hast, and mayst always obtain,

reason and discretion) may be? 
XLVI. The ambitious supposeth another man’s act, praise and applause, to be his 
own happiness; the voluptuous his own sense and feeling; but he that is wise, his 
own action. 
XLVII. It is in thy power absolutely to exclude all manner of conceit and opinion, as 
concerning this matter; and by the same means, to exclude all grief and sorrow from 
thy soul. For as for the things and objects themselves, they of themselves have no 
such power, whereby to beget and force upon us any opinion at all.

that might otherwise trouble thee, let this memento presently come to thy 
mind, that it is that which thou hast already often Seen and known. Generally, above 
and below, thou shalt find but the same things. The very same things whereof an-
cient stories, middle age stories, and fresh stories are full whereof towns are full, and 
houses full. There is nothing that is new. All things that are, are both usual and of

should become dead in thee, and lose their proper power and efficacy to make thee 
live happy, as long as those proper and correlative fancies, and representations of 
things on which they mutually depend (which continually to stir up and revive is in

XI. Of things that are external, happen what will to that which can suffer by external 
accidents. Those things that suffer let them complain themselves, if they will; as for 
me, as long as I conceive no such thing, that that which is happened is evil, I have 
no hurt; and it is in my power not to conceive any such thing. 
XII. Whatsoever any man either doth or saith, thou must be good; not for any man’s 
sake, but for thine own nature’s sake; as if either gold, or the emerald, or purple, 
should ever be saying to themselves, Whatsoever any man either doth or saith, I 
must still be an emerald, and I must keep my colour.

XIII. This may ever be my comfort and security: my understanding, that ruleth over 
all, will not of itself bring trouble and vexation upon itself. This I say; it will not put 
itself in any fear, it will not lead itself into any concupiscence. If it be in the power of 
any other to compel it to fear, or to grieve, it is free for him to use his power. But 
sure if itself do not of itself, through some false opinion or supposition incline itself 
to any such disposition; there is no fear. For as for the body, why should I make the 
grief of my body, to be the grief of my mind? If that itself can either fear or complain,

let it. But as for the soul, which indeed, can only be truly sensible of either fear or 
grief; to which only it belongs according to its different imaginations and opinions, to 
admit of either of these, or of their contraries; thou mayst look to that thyself, that it 
suffer nothing. Induce her not to any such opinion or persuasion. The understanding 
is of itself sufficient unto itself, and needs not (if itself doth not bring itself to need) 
any other thing besides itself, and by consequent as it needs nothing, so neither can 
it be troubled or hindered by anything, if itself doth not trouble and hinder itself.

that he may be ready for it, and that nothing may cast him down.

doubt of, whether it were so or no, or, which above all the rest, if so be that it were 
true, a man would well consider of, whether commendable, or discommendable. The

whether his disposition was such; as that all that he stood upon, and sought after in

holily towards the Gods. Neither vexing himself to no purpose at the wickedness of

others, nor yet ever condescending to any man’s evil fact, or evil intentions, through 
either fear, or engagement of friendship. Whether of those things that happened unto 
him by God’s appointment, he neither did wonder at any when it did happen, or 
thought it intolerable in the trial of it. And lastly, whether he never did suffer his 
mind to sympathise with the senses, and affections of the body. For we must not 
think that Nature hath so mixed and tempered it with the body, as that she hath not 
power to circumscribe herself, and by herself to intend her own ends and occasions.

men. For either unto God or man, whatsoever it is that doth happen in the world 
hath in the ordinary course of nature its proper reference; neither is there anything, 
that in regard of nature is either new, or reluctant and intractable, but all things 
both usual and easy. 
XL. Then hath a man attained to the estate of perfection in his life and conversation, 
when he so spends every day, as if it were his last day: never hot and vehement in 
his affections, nor yet so cold and stupid as one that had no sense; and free from all

XLI. Can the Gods, who are immortal, for the continuance of so many ages bear 
without indignation with such and so many sinners, as have ever been, yea not only 
so, but also take such care for them, that they want nothing; and dust thou so griev-
ously take on, as one that could bear with them no longer; thou that art but for a 
moment of time? yea thou that art one of those sinners thyself? A very ridiculous 
thing it is, that any man should dispense with vice and wickedness in himself, which 
is in his power to restrain; and should go about to suppress it in others, which is al-
together impossible.

XLII. What object soever, our reasonable and sociable faculty doth meet with, that 
affords nothing either for the satisfaction of reason, or for the practice of charity, she 
worthily doth think unworthy of herself. 
XLIII. When thou hast done well, and another is benefited by thy action, must thou 
like a very fool look for a third thing besides, as that it may appear unto others also 
that thou hast done well, or that thou mayest in time, receive one good turn for an-
other? No man useth to be weary of that which is beneficial unto him. But every ac-

XLIV. The nature of the universe did once certainly before it was created, whatsoever 
it hath done since, deliberate and so resolve upon the creation of the world. Now 
since that time, whatsoever it is, that is and happens in the world, is either but a 
consequent of that one and first deliberation: or if so be that this ruling rational part 
of the world, takes any thought and care of things particular, they are surely his rea-
sonable and principal creatures, that are the proper object of his particular care and 
providence. This often thought upon, will much conduce to thy tranquillity.

ry it to another place. So that thou needest not fear any new thing. For all things are 
usual and ordinary; and all things are disposed by equality.

reasonable nature doth then speed, when first in matter of fancies and imaginations,

XII. As every fancy and imagination presents itself unto thee, consider (if it be possi-
ble) the true nature, and the proper qualities of it, and reason with thyself about it. 
XIII. At thy first encounter with any one, say presently to thyself: This man, what are 
his opinions concerning that which is good or evil? as concerning pain, pleasure, and 
the causes of both; concerning honour, and dishonour, concerning life and death? 
thus and thus. Now if it be no wonder that a man should have such and such opin-
ions, how can it be a wonder that he should do such and such things? I will remem-

member, that as it is a shame for any man to wonder that a fig tree should bear figs, 
so also to wonder that the world should bear anything, whatsoever it is which in the 
ordinary course of nature it may bear. To a physician also and to a pilot it is a shame 
either for the one to wonder, that such and such a one should have an ague; or for 
the other, that the winds should prove Contrary.

able to rectify thee, is equally ingenuous, as to find out at the first, what is right and

able to rectify thee, is equally ingenuous, as to find out at the first, what is right and

own deliberation and jun. merit, arid of thine own understanding. 
XV. If it were thine act and in thine own power, why wouldest thou do it? If it were 
not, whom dost tin accuse? the atoms, or the Gods? For to do either, the part of a 
mad man. Thou must therefore blame nobody, but if it be in thy power, redress what 
is amiss; if it be not, to what end is it to complain? For nothing should be done but 
to some certain end.

but thou hadst rather become good to-morrow, than to be so to-day.

That which is a hindrance of the appetitive and prosecutive faculty, is an evil to the 
sensitive nature. As of the sensitive, so of the vegetative constitution, whatsoever is a 
hindrance unto it, is also in that respect an evil unto the same. And so likewise, 
whatsoever is a hindrance unto the mind and understanding, must needs be the 
proper evil of the reasonable nature. Now apply all those things unto thyself. Do ei-

XLVI. Remember that thy mind is of that nature as that it becometh altogether un-
conquerable, when once recollected in herself, she seeks no other content than this, 
that she cannot be forced: yea though it so fall out, that it be even against reason it-
self, that it cloth bandy. How much less when by the help of reason she is able to 
judge of things with discretion? And therefore let thy chief fort and place of defence 
be, a mind free from passions. A stronger place, (whereunto to make his refuge, and 
so to become impregnable) and better fortified than this, bath no man. He that seeth

fountain of sweet and clear water, though she be cursed by some stander by, yet do 
her springs nevertheless still run as sweet and clear as before; yea though either dirt

happen indifferently in the ordinary course of things, which by a necessary conse-
quence, whether as principal or accessory, come to pass in the world, according to 
that first and ancient deliberation of Providence, by which she from some certain be-
ginning, did resolve upon the creation of such a world, conceiving then in her womb 
as it were some certain rational generative seeds and faculties of things future, 
whether subjects, changes, successions; both such and such, and just so many.

For a far greater plague is the corruption of the mind, than any certain change and 
distemper of the common air can be. This is a plague of creatures, as they are living 
creatures; but that of men as they are men or reasonable.

come forth, thou mayst expect also when thy soul shall fall off from that outward 
coat or skin: wherein as a child in the belly it lieth involved and shut up. But thou

young ones, and a kind of mutual love and affection. For though but unreasonable, 
yet a kind of soul these had, and therefore was that natural desire of union more 
strong and intense in them, as in creatures of a more excellent nature, than either in 
plants, or stones, or trees. But among reasonable creatures, begun commonwealths, 
friendships, families, public meetings, and even in their wars, conventions, and truc-

some mutual correspondency and unity. So proper is it to excellency in a high degree

sympathy. But now behold, what is now come to pass. Those creatures that are rea-
sonable, are now the only creatures that have forgotten their natural affection and 
inclination of one towards another. Among them alone of all other things that are of 
one kind, there is not to be found a general disposition to flow together. But though 
they fly from nature, yet are they stopt in their course, and apprehended. Do they

itself doth enjoy. Reason is of a diffusive nature, what itself is in itself, it begets in

XIX. Of an operation and of a purpose there is an ending, or of an action and of a 
purpose we say commonly, that it is at an end: from opinion also there is an absolute 
cessation, which is as it were the death of it. In all this there is no hurt. Apply this 
now to a man’s age, as first, a child; then a youth, then a young man, then an old 
man; every change from one age to another is a kind of death And all this while here 
no matter of grief yet. Pass now unto that life first, that which thou livedst under thy 
grandfather, then under thy mother, then under thy father. And thus when through

XXII. Children’s anger, mere babels; wretched souls bearing up dead bodies, that 
they may not have their fall so soon: even as it is in that common dirge song. 
XXIII. Go to the quality of the cause from which the effect doth proceed. Behold it by 
itself bare and naked, separated from all that is material. Then consider the utmost 
bounds of time that that cause, thus and thus qualified, can subsist and abide.

reason of this only, because that for all happiness it did not suffice thee, or, that 
thou didst not account it sufficient happiness, that thy understanding did operate 
according to its natural constitution. 
XXV. When any shall either impeach thee with false accusations, or hatefully re-
proach thee, or shall use any such carriage towards thee, get thee presently to their 
minds and understandings, and look in them, and behold what manner of men they 
be. Thou shalt see, that there is no such occasion why it should trouble thee, what 
such as they are think of thee. Yet must thou love them still, for by nature they are 
thy friends. And the Gods themselves, in those things that they seek from them as

ing still the same. And either of everything in particular before it come to pass, the 
mind of the universe doth consider with itself and deliberate: and if so, then submit 
for shame unto the determination of such an excellent understanding: or once for all

change. And then the course will be, from one period of eternity unto another, and so 
a perpetual eternity. Now can any man that shall consider with himself in his mind

II. As one who is altogether governed by nature, let it be thy care to observe what it is 
that thy nature in general doth require. That done, if thou find not that thy nature, 
as thou art a living sensible creature, will be the worse for it, thou mayest proceed.

VI. Either with Epicurus, we must fondly imagine the atoms to be the cause of all 
things, or we must needs grant a nature. Let this then be thy first ground, that thou 
art part of that universe, which is governed by nature. Then secondly, that to those 
parts that are of the same kind and nature as thou art, thou hast relation of kindred. 
For of these, if I shall always be mindful, first as I am a part, I shall never be dis-
pleased with anything, that falls to my particular share of the common chances of 
the world. For nothing that is behoveful unto the whole, can be truly hurtful to that

tain nothing in themselves that is hurtful unto them; it cannot be that the nature of 
the universe (whose privilege beyond other particular natures, is, that she cannot 
against her will by any higher external cause be constrained), should beget anything 
and cherish it in her bosom that should tend to her own hurt and prejudice. As then 
I bear in mind that I am a part of such an universe, I shall not be displeased with 
anything that happens. And as I have relation of kindred to those parts that are of

should say, to speak truly and properly; but that I may be the better understood, I 
am content at this time to use that more common word. Now say I, if so be that this 
be both hurtful unto them, and yet unavoidable, would not, thinkest thou, the whole 
itself be in a sweet case, all the parts of it being subject to alteration, yea and by 
their making itself fitted for corruption, as consisting of things different and contra-
ry? And did nature then either of herself thus project and purpose the affliction and

stupid sloth: this is thy daily slavery. By little and little, if thou doest not better look 
to it, those sacred dogmata will be blotted out of thy mind. How many things be 
there, which when as a mere naturalist, thou hast barely considered of according to 
their nature, thou doest let pass without any further use? Whereas thou shouldst in 
all things so join action and contemplation, that thou mightest both at the same time 
attend all present occasions, to perform everything duly and carefully and yet so in-
tend the contemplative part too, that no part of that delight and pleasure, which the 
contemplative knowledge of everything according to its true nature doth of itself af-

suspicion concerning that which is future, trouble thy mind at all? What now is to be 
done, if thou mayest search and inquiry into that, what needs thou care for more? 
And if thou art well able to perceive it alone, let no man divert thee from it. But if 
alone thou doest not so well perceive it, suspend thine action, and take advice from 
the best. And if there be anything else that doth hinder thee, go on with prudence

himself alone upon some desert hill. For whether here, or there, if the whole world be 
but as one town, it matters not much for the place. Let them behold and see a man,

often as desirous to fall upon the earth, which argues a mutual kind of love between 
them. And so (say I) doth the world bear a certain affection of love to whatsoever 
shall come to pass With thine affections shall mine concur, O world. The same (and 
no other) shall the object of my longing be which is of thine. Now that the world doth 
love it is true indeed so is it as commonly said, and acknowledged ledged, when, ac-
cording to the Greek phrase, imitated by the Latins, of things that used to be, we say 
commonly, that they love to be.37

with it. Another cause succeedeth, and undertakes the work, and in time brings a 
child (that wonderful effect from such a beginning!) to perfection. Again, man lets 
food down through his throat; and that once down, he hath no more to do with it. 
Another cause succeedeth and distributeth this food into the senses, and the affec-
tions: into life, and into strength; and doth with it those other many and marvellous

within a while after. 
XXXV. A good eye must be good to see whatsoever is to be seen, and not green things 
only. For that is proper to sore eyes. So must a good ear, and a good smell be ready 
for whatsoever is either to be heard, or smelt: and a good stomach as indifferent to 
all kinds of food, as a millstone is, to whatsoever she was made for to grind. As ready 
therefore must a sound understanding be for whatsoever shall happen. But he that 
saith, O that my children might live! and, O that all men might commend me for 
whatsoever I do! is an eye that seeks after green things; or as teeth, after that which 
is tender.

XXXVI. There is not any man that is so happy in his death, but that some of those 
that are by him when he dies, will be ready to rejoice at his supposed calamity. Is it 
one that was virtuous and wise indeed? will there not some one or other be found, 
who thus will say to himself; “Well now at last shall I be at rest from this pedagogue. 
He did not indeed otherwise trouble us much: but I know well enough that in his 
heart, he did much condemn us.” Thus will they speak of the virtuous. But as for us, 
alas I how many things be there, for which there be many that glad would be to be 
rid of us. This therefore if thou shalt think of whensoever thou diest, thou shalt die

whom I have so much suffered for, so often prayed for, and for whom I have taken 
such care, even they would have me die, hoping that after my death they shall live 
happier, than they did before. What then should any man desire to continue here 
any longer? Nevertheless, whensoever thou diest, thou must not be less kind and 
loving unto them for it; but as before, see them, continue to be their friend, to wish 
them well, and meekly, and gently to carry thyself towards them, but yet so that on

the other side, it make thee not the more unwilling to die. But as it fareth with them 
that die an easy quick death, whose soul is soon separated from their bodies, so 
must thy separation from them be. To these had nature joined and annexed me: now 
she parts us; I am ready to depart, as from friends and kinsmen, but yet without ei-
ther reluctancy or compulsion. For this also is according to Nature. 
XXXVII. Use thyself; as often, as thou seest any man do anything, presently (if it be 
possible) to say unto thyself, What is this man’s end in this his action? But begin 
this course with thyself first of all, and diligently examine thyself concerning whatso-
ever thou doest.

occasions may present itself unto thy mind, and never cease to think of it. What is

Concerning the proper and particular constitution of man?

divides himself from the whole body, or corporation. But herein is the gift and mercy 
of God, the Author of this society, in that, once cut off we may grow together and be-
come part of the whole again. But if this happen often the misery is that the further a 
man is run in this division, the harder he is to be reunited and restored again: and 
however the branch which, once cut of afterwards was graffed in, gardeners can tell 
you is not like that which sprouted together at first, and still continued in the unity 
of the body.

fection; but not in matter of opinions. They that shall oppose thee in thy right cours-
es, as it is not in their power to divert thee from thy good action, so neither let it be 
to divert thee from thy good affection towards them. But be it thy care to keep thyself 
constant in both; both in a right judgment and action, and in true meekness towards 
them, that either shall do their endeavour to hinder thee, or at least will be dis-
pleased with thee for what thou hast done. For to fail in either (either in the one to

nature is both thy friend and thy kinsman) is equally base, and much savouring of 
the disposition of a cowardly fugitive soldier. 
IX. It is not possible that any nature should be inferior unto art, since that all arts 
imitate nature. If this be so; that the most perfect and general nature of all natures 
should in her operation come short of the skill of arts, is most improbable. Now 
common is it to all arts, to make that which is worse for the better’s sake. Much 
more then doth the common nature do the same. Hence is the first ground of justice.

From justice all other virtues have their existence. For justice cannot be preserved, if 
either we settle our minds and affections upon worldly things; or be apt to be de-
ceived, or rash, and inconstant. 
X. The things themselves (which either to get or to avoid thou art put to so much 
trouble) come not unto thee themselves; but thou in a manner goest unto them. Let 
then thine own judgment and opinion concerning those things be at rest; and as for 
the things themselves, they stand still and quiet, without any noise or stir at all; and

by, as soon as ever he comes near him, may as it were smell him whether he will or 
no. But the affectation of simplicity is nowise laudable. There is nothing more

she must consider all worldly objects both divided and whole: remembering withal 
that no object can of itself beget any opinion in us, neither can come to us, but 
stands without still and quiet; but that we ourselves beget, and as it were print in 
ourselves opinions concerning them. Now it is in our power, not to print them; and if 
they creep in and lurk in some corner, it is in our power to wipe them off. Remember-

forbear the very act of some sins, yet hast thou in thyself an habitual disposition to 
them, but that either through fear, or vainglory, or some such other ambitious fool-
ish respect, thou art restrained. Fifthly, that whether they have sinned or no, thou 
doest not understand perfectly. For many things are done by way of discreet policy; 
and generally a man must know many things first, before he be able truly and judi-
ciously to judge of another man’s action. Sixthly, that whensoever thou doest take on 
grievously, or makest great woe, little doest thou remember then that a man’s life is 
but for a moment of time, and that within a while we shall all be in our graves. Sev-
enthly, that it is not the sins and transgressions themselves that trouble us properly;

shameful. For if that which is shameful, be not the only true evil that is, thou also 
wilt be driven whilest thou doest follow the common instinct of nature, to avoid that 
which is evil, to commit many unjust things, and to become a thief, and anything,

grief doth proceed from weakness, so doth anger. For both, both he that is angry and 
that grieveth, have received a wound, and cowardly have as it were yielded them-
selves unto their affections. If thou wilt have a tenth also, receive this tenth gift from 
Hercules the guide and leader of the Muses: that is a mad man’s part, to look that 
there should be no wicked men in the world, because it is impossible. Now for a man 
to brook well enough, that there should be wicked men in the world, but not to en-
dure that any should transgress against himself, is against all equity, and indeed ty-
rannical.

XVII. Four several dispositions or inclinations there be of the mind and understand-
ing, which to be aware of, thou must carefully observe: and whensoever thou doest 
discover them, thou must rectify them, saying to thyself concerning every one of 
them, This imagination is not necessary; this is uncharitable: this thou shalt speak 
as another man’s slave, or instrument; than which nothing can be more senseless 
and absurd: for the fourth, thou shalt sharply check and upbraid thyself; for that 
thou doest suffer that more divine part in thee, to become subject and obnoxious to 
that more ignoble part of thy body, and the gross lusts and concupiscences thereof.

here below in this mixed body. So whatsoever is in thee, either earthy, or humid, alt-
hough by nature it tend downwards, yet is it against its nature both raised upwards,

universe, abiding patiently wheresoever (though against their nature) they are 
placed, until the sound as it were of their retreat, and separation. Is it not a grievous

mon bugbears of the world: the proper terror of silly children.

forms for their strangers in the shadow, they themselves were content to sit any-

his wife having taken away his clothes, and carried them abroad with her, and what 
he said to his fellows and friends, who were ashamed; and out of respect to him, did

reason.

so: that we should find a certain art and method of assenting; and that we should

always be with their due restraint and reservation, always charitable, and according 
to the true worth of every present object. And as for earnest longing, that we should

XXXII. Socrates said, “What will you have? the souls of reasonable, or unreasonable 
creatures? Of reasonable. But what? Of those whose reason is sound and perfect? or 
of those whose reason is vitiated and corrupted? Of those whose reason is sound and 
perfect. Why then labour ye not for such? Because we have them already. What then 
do ye so strive and contend between you?”

HATSOEVER THOU DOEST hereafter aspire unto, thou mayest even now en-
joy and possess, if thou doest not envy thyself thine own happiness. And 
that will be, if thou shalt forget all that is past, and for the future, refer 
thyself wholly to the Divine Providence, and shalt bend and apply all thy present 
thoughts and intentions to holiness and righteousness. To holiness, in accepting 
willingly whatsoever is sent by the Divine Providence, as being that which the nature 
of the universe hath appointed unto thee, which also hath appointed thee for that,

III. I have often wondered how it should come to pass, that every man loving himself 
best, should more regard other men’s opinions concerning himself than his own. For 
if any God or grave master standing by, should command any of us to think nothing 
by himself but what he should presently speak out; no man were able to endure it, 
though but for one day. Thus do we fear more what our neighbours will think of us, 
than what we ourselves. 
IV. How come it to pass that the Gods having ordered all other things so well and so 
lovingly, should be overseen in this one only thing, that whereas then. hath been

some very good men that have made many covenants as it were with God and by 
many holy actions and outward services contracted a kind of familiarity with Him; 
that these men when once they are dead, should never be restored to life, but be ex-
tinct for ever. But this thou mayest be sure of, that this (if it be so indeed) would 
never have been so ordered by the Gods, had it been fit otherwise. For certainly it 
was possible, had it been more just so and had it been according to nature, the na-
ture of the universe would easily have borne it. But now because it is not so, (if so be 
that it be not so indeed) be therefore confident that it was not fit it should be so. for

any evil, because it is at an end. Neither can he that is the author of that operation; 
for this very respect, because his operation is at an end, be said to suffer any evil. 
Likewise then, neither can the whole body of all our actions (which is our life) if in

not proud and high conceited, is of all kind of pride and presumption, the most intol-

of all, that even to the very eye, they are in some manner visible and apparent. Sec-

then for the Gods, by the daily experience that I have of their power and providence 
towards myself and others, I know certainly that they are, and therefore worship 
them.

all these seems unto thee a worthy object of thy desire? Now if of all these thou doest 
find that they be but little worth in themselves, proceed on unto the last, which is, in 
all things to follow God and reason. But for a man to grieve that by death he shall be 
deprived of any of these things, is both against God and reason.

misery, did nevertheless many of them contemn death as much as any. And can 
death be terrible to him, to whom that only seems good, which in the ordinary course 
of nature is seasonable? to him, to whom, whether his actions be many or few, so 
they be all good, is all one; and who whether he behold the things of the world being 
always the same either for many years, or for few years only, is altogether indiffer-

CORRESPONDENCE OF M. AURELIUS ANTONINUS AND M. CORNELIUS FRONTO 
CORNELIUS FRONTO48 was a Roman by descent, but of provincial birth, be-
ing native to Cirta, in Numidia. Thence he migrated to Rome in the reign of 
Hadrian, and became the most famous rhetorician of his day. As a pleader 
and orator he was counted by his contemporaries hardly inferior to Tully himself, 
and as a teacher his aid was sought for the noblest youths of Rome. To him was en-
trusted the education of M. Aurelius and of his colleague L. Verus in their boyhood; 
and he was rewarded for his efforts by a seat in the Senate and the consular rank

and he was rewarded for his efforts by a seat in the Senate and the consular rank 
(A.D. 143). By the exercise of his profession he became wealthy; and if he speaks of 
his means as not great,49 he must be comparing his wealth with the grandees of 
Rome, not with the ordinary citizen. 
Before the present century nothing was known of the works of Fronto, except a 
grammatical treatise; but in 1815 Cardinal Mai published a number of letters and 
some short essays of Fronto, which he had discovered in a palimpsest at Milan. Oth-
er parts of the same MS. he found later in the Vatican, the whole being collected and 
edited in the year 1823. We now possess parts of his correspondence with Antoninus 
Pius, with M. Aurelius, with L. Verus, and with certain of his friends, and also sever-

al rhetorical and historical fragments. Though none of the more ambitious works of 
Fronto have survived, there are enough to give proof of his powers. Never was a great 
literary reputation less deserved. It would be bard to conceive of anything more vapid 
than the style and conception of these letters; clearly the man was a pedant without 
imagination or taste. Such indeed was the age he lived in, and it is no marvel that he 
was like to his age. But there must have been more in him than mere pedantry; there 
was indeed a heart in the man, which Marcus found, arid he found also a tongue 
which could speak the truth. Fronto’s letters are by no means free from exaggeration

and laudation, but they do not show that loathsome flattery which filled the Roman 
court. He really admires what he praises, and his way of saying so is not unlike what 
often passes for criticism at the present day. He is not afraid to reprove what he 
thinks amiss; and the astonishment of Marcus at this will prove, if proof were need-
ed, that he was not used to plain dealing. “How happy I am,” he writes, “that my 
friend Marcus Cornelius, so distinguished as an orator and so noble as a man, 
thinks me worth praising and blaming.”50 In another place he deems himself blest

it is not easy to understand the friendship which remained between them up to the 
last. 
An example of the frankness which was between them is given by a difference they 
had over the case of Herodes Atticus. Herodes was a Greek rhetorician who had a 
school at Rome, and Marcus Aurelius was among his pupils. Both Marcus and the 
Emperor Antoninus had a high opinion of Herodes; and all we know goes to prove he 
was a man of high character and princely generosity. When quite young he was made 
administrator of the free cities in Asia, nor is it surprising to find that he made bitter

enemies there; indeed, a just ruler was sure to make enemies. The end of it was that 
an Athenian deputation, headed by the orators Theodotus and Demostratus, made 
serious accusations against his honour. There is no need to discuss the merits of the 
case here; suffice it to say, Herodes succeeded in defending himself to the satisfac-
tion of the emperor. Pronto appears to have taken the delegates’ part, and to have 
accepted a brief for the prosecution, urged to some extent by personal considera-
tions; and in this cause Marcus Aurelius writes to Fronto as follows:

that so far from rejecting my counsel, you have even approved it. As to the 
question you raise in your kind letter, my opinion is this: all that concerns the 
case which you are supporting must be clearly brought forward; what concerns 
your own feelings, though you may have had just provocation, should be left 
unsaid.”

The story does credit to both. Fronto shows no loss of temper at the interference, nor 
shrinks from stating his case with frankness; and Marcus, with forbearance remark-
able in a prince, does not command that his friend be left unmolested, but merely 
stipulates for a fair trial on the merits of the case. 
Another example may he given from a letter of Fronto’s:54 
“Here is something else quarrelsome and querulous. I have sometimes found 
fault with you in your absence somewhat seriously in the company of a few of 
my most intimate friends: at times, for example, when you mixt in society with

when anger got the better of me. But did any one else in the same banquet 
speak against you, I could not endure to hear it with equanimity. Thus it was 
easier for me to say something to your disadvantage myself, than to hear others 
do it; just as I could more easily bear to chastise my daughter Gratia, than to 
see her chastised by another.”

Marcus Aurelius seems to have been about eighteen years of age when the corre-
spondence begins, Fronto being some thirty years older.63 The systematic education 
of the young prince seems to have been finisht, and Pronto now acts more as his ad-
viser than his tutor. He recommends the prince to use simplicity in his public

Cato and Gracchus.65 Pronto urges on him the study of Cicero, whose letters, he 
says, are all worth reading. 
When he wishes to compliment Marcus he declares one or other of his letters has the 
true Tullian ring. Marcus gives his nights to reading when he ought to be sleeping. 
He exercises himself in verse composition and on rhetorical themes. 
“It is very nice of you,” he writes to Fronto,66 “to ask for my hexameters; I would 
have sent them at once if I had them by me. The fact is my secretary, Anicetus

sleepy in the daylight, and so I don’t do much. Yet I have made extracts from

Sometimes Fronto sends him a theme to work up, as thus: “M. Lucilius tribune of 
the people violently throws into prison a free Roman citizen, against the opinion of 
his colleagues who demand his release. For this act he is branded by the censor. An-
alyse the case, and then take both sides in turn, attacking and defending.”68 Or

again: “A Roman consul, doffing his state robe, dons the gauntlet and kills a lion 
amongst the young men at the Quinquatrus in full view of the people of Rome. De-
nunciation before the censors.”69 The prince has a fair knowledge of Greek, and 
quotes from Homer, Plato, Euripides, but for some reason Fronto dissuaded him 
from this study.70 His Meditations are written in Greek. He continued his literary 
studies throughout his life, and after he became emperor we still find him asking his 
adviser for copies of Cicero’s Letters, by which he hopes to improve his vocabulary.71 
Pronto Helps him with a supply of similes, which, it seems, he did not think of readi-
ly. It is to be feared that the fount of Marcus’s eloquence was pumped up by artificial 
means.

Some idea of his literary style may he gathered from the letter which follows:72 
“I heard Polemo declaim the other day, to say something of things sublunary. If 
you ask what I thought of him, listen. He seems to me an industrious farmer, 
endowed with the greatest skill, who has cultivated a large estate for corn and 
vines only, and indeed with a rich return of fine crops. But yet in that land of 
his there is no Pompeian fig or Arician vegetable, no Tarentine rose, or pleasing 
coppice, or thick grove, or shady plane tree; all is for use rather than for pleas-
ure, such as one ought rather to commend, but cares not to love.

theme Marcus fairly bubbles over with enthusiasm.

decide it: for me, if I dare say so, I never read any invective of Cato’s so fine as

Sometimes Fronto descends from the heights of eloquence to offer practical advice; 
as when he suggests how Marcus should deal with his suite. It is more difficult, he 
admits, to keep courtiers in harmony than to tame lions with a lute; but if it is to be 
done, it must be by eradicating jealousy. “Do not let your friends,” says Fronto,”77 
“envy each other, or think that what you give to another is filched from them. . . . 
Keep away envy from your suite, and you will find your friends kindly and harmoni-
ous.”

Here and there we meet with allusions to his daily life, which we could wish to be 
more frequent. He goes to the theatre or the law-courts,78 or takes part in court cer-
emony, but his heart is always with his books. The vintage season, with its religious 
rites, was always spent by Antoninus Pius in the country. The following letters give 
sonic notion of a day’s occupation at that time: 
79 “MY DEAREST MASTER, — I am well. To-day I studied from the ninth hour of 
the night to the second hour of day, after taking food. I then put on my slip-
pers, and from time second to the third hour had a most enjoyable walk up and

down before my chamber. Then booted and cloaked — for so we were com-
manded to appear — I went to wait upon my lord the emperor. We went a-
hunting, did doughty deeds, heard a rumour that boars had been caught, but 
there was nothing to see. However, we climbed a pretty steep hill, and in the af-
ternoon returned home. I went straight to my books. Off with the boots, down 
with the cloak; I spent a couple of hours in bed. I read Cato’s speech on the 
Property of Pulchra, and another in which he impeaches a tribune. Ho, ho! I 
hear you cry to your man, Off with you as fast as you can, and bring me these 
speeches from the library of Apollo. No use to send: I have those books with me

in writing, not quite so badly as yesterday indeed. Then, after waiting upon my 
father, I soothed my throat with honey-water, ejecting it without swallowing: I 
might say gargle, but I won’t, though I think the word is found in Novius and 
elsewhere. After attending to my throat I went to my father, and stood by his 
side as he sacrificed. Then to luncheon. What do you think I had to eat? A bit of 
bread so big, while I watched others gobbling boiled beans, onions, and fish full 
of roe. Then we set to work at gathering the grapes, with plenty of sweat and

survivors of the vintage.” After the sixth hour we returned home. I did a little 
work, and poor work at that. Then I had a long gossip with my dear mother sit-

usual, and rode on ahead some little way. Well, there on the road was a herd of

sheep, standing all crowded together as though the place were a desert, with 
four dogs and two shepherds, but nothing else. Then one shepherd said to an-
other shepherd, on seeing a number of horsemen: ‘I say,’ says he, ‘look you at 
those horsemen; they do a deal of robbery.’ When I heard this, I clap spurs to 
my horse, and ride straight for the sheep. In consternation the sheep scatter; 
hither and thither they are fleeting and bleating. A shepherd throws his fork, 
and the fork falls on the horseman who came next to me. We make our escape.” 
We like Marcus none the worse for this spice of mischief.

was written twice, as follows: ‘Priest don the fell.’84 I asked one of the inhabit-
ants what that word was. He said it was the word in the Hernican dialect for 
the victim’s skin, which the priest puts over his conical cap when he enters the 
city. I found out many other things which I desired to know, but the only thing 
I do not desire is that you should he absent from me; that is my chief anxiety.

Making all allowances for conventional exaggerations, it is clear from the corre-
spondence that there was deep love between Marcus and his preceptor. The letters 
cover several years in succession, but soon after the birth of Marcus’s daughter, 
Faustina, there is a large gap. It does not follow that the letters ceased entirely, be-
cause we know part of the collection is lost; but there was probably less intercourse

cause we know part of the collection is lost; but there was probably less intercourse 
between Marcus and Fronto after Marcus took to the study of philosophy under the 
guidance of Rusticus. 
When Marcus succeeded to the throne in 161, the letters begin again, with slightly 
increased formality on Fronto’s part, and they go on for some four years, when Fron-
to, who has been continually complaining of ill-health, appears to have died. One let-
ter of the later period gives some interesting particulars of the emperor’s public life,

usual strain of high praise, and then continues:85

After the preceptorial letters cease the others are concerned with domestic events, 
health and sickness, visits or introductions, birth or death. Thus the emperor writes 
to his old friend, who had shown some diffidence in seeking an interview:87 
“TO MY MASTER.

nor spoke to you, though you visited the palace, and the moment after I had 
left the prince my brother. I reproached my brother severely for not recalling 
me; nor durst he deny the fault.” 
Fronto again writes on one occasion: “I have seen your daughter. It was like seeing 
you and Faustina in infancy, so much that is charming her face has taken from each 
of yours.” Or again, at a later date:88 
“I have seen your chicks, most delightful sight that ever I saw in my life, so like 
you that nothing is more like than the likeness. . . . By the mercy of Heaven 
they have a healthy colour and strong lungs. One held a piece of white bread, 
like a little prince, the other a common piece, like a true philosophers son.”

Marcus, we know, was devoted to his children. They were delicate in health, in spite 
of Fronto’s assurance, and only one son survived the father. We find echoes of this 
affection now and again in the letters. “We have summer heat here still,” writes Mar-
cus, “but since my little girls are pretty well, if I may say so, it is like the bracing cli-

ow of death, her father at once writes to inform Fronto.90 The sympathy he asks he 
also gives, and as old age brings more and more infirmity, Marcus becomes even 
more solicitous for his beloved teacher. The poor old man suffered a heavy blow in 
the death of his grandson, on which Marcus writes:91 “I have just heard of your mis-
fortune. Feeling grieved as I do when one of your joints gives you pain, what do you 
think I feel, dear master, when you have pain of mind?” The old man’s reply, in spite

think I feel, dear master, when you have pain of mind?” The old man’s reply, in spite 
of a certain self-consciousness, is full of pathos. He recounts with pride the events of 
a long and upright life, in which he has wronged no man, and lived in harmony with 
his friends and family. His affectations fall away from him, as the cry of pain is 
forced from his heart: 
92 “Many such sorrows has fortune visited me with all my life long. To pass by 
my other afflictions, I have lost five children under the most pitiful conditions 
possible: for the five I lost one by one when each was my only child, suffering 
these blows of bereavement in such a manner that each child was born to one 
already bereaved. Thus I ever lost my children without solace, and got them 
amidst fresh grief. . . . ”

The letter continues with reflections on the nature of death, “more to be rejoiced at 
than bewailed, the younger one dies,” and an arraignment of Providence not without 
dignity, wrung from him as it were by this last culminating misfortune. It concludes 
with a summing-up of his life in protest against the blow which has fallen on his grey 
head: 
“Through my long life I have committed nothing which might bring dishonour, 
or disgrace, or shame: no deed of avarice or treachery have I done in all my

and, says he, “Fronto taught me not to expect natural affection from the highly-
born.” Fronto really said more than this: that “affection” is not a Roman quality, nor 
has it a Latin name.95 Roman or not Roman, Marcus found affection in Fronto; and if 
he outgrew his master’s intellectual training, he never lost touch with the true heart 
of the man it is that which Fronto’s name brings up to his remembrance, not disser-
tations on compound verbs or fatuous criticisms of style.

Notes 
HIS BEING NEITHER A CRITICAL EDITION of the text nor an emended edition of 
Casaubon’s translation, it has not been thought necessary to add full notes. 
Casaubon’s own notes have been omitted, because for the most part they are 
discursive, and not necessary to an understanding of what is written. In those which 
here follow, certain emendations of his are mentioned, which he proposes in his 
notes, and follows in the translation. In addition, one or two corrections are made 
where he has mistaken the Greek, and the translation might be misleading. Those 
which do not come under these two heads will explain themselves.

where he has mistaken the Greek, and the translation might be misleading. Those 
which do not come under these two heads will explain themselves. 
The text itself has been prepared by a comparison of the editions of 1634 and 1635. 
It should he borne in mind that Casaubon’s is often rather a paraphrase than a close 
translation; and it did not seem worth while to notice every variation or amplification 
of the original. In the original editions all that Casaubon conceives as understood, 
but not expressed, is enclosed in square brackets. These brackets are here omitted, 
as they interfere with the comfort of the reader; and so have some of the alternative 
renderings suggested by the translator. In a few cases, Latin words in the text have 
been replaced by English.

CIRCUS, the Circus Maximus at Rome, 
where games were held. There were 
four companies who contracted to pro-
vide horses, drivers, etc. These were 
called Factiones, and each had its dis-
tinguishing colour: russata (red), al-
bata (white), veneta (blue), prasina 
(green). There was high rivalry between 
them, and riots and bloodshed not in-
frequently. 
CITHAERON, a mountain range N. of 
Attica. 
COMEDY, ANCIENT; a term applied to 
the Attic comedy of Aristophanes and 
his time, which criticised persons and 
politics, like a modern comic journal, 
such as Punch. See New Comedy.
